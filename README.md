Website starter kit :)

## Ingredients

* [Astro](https://astro.build/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/)
* [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)

## Structure

This project follows [Astro's structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) with a few additions:

* Node version files for [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)
* Config files for [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and Tailwind CSS
* Client-side JS modules (if any) in `src/client/`

## Install

[Use this template](https://github.com/zbo14/site/generate), clone the repo, and `npm i`.

## Lint

`npm run lint`

This lints everything in `src/`, including CSS, and runs on the git `pre-commit` hook.
